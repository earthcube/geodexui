# GeoDex UI

## About

Simple UI for the test site geodex.org

To testing the site you should be able to 

```
cd ./geodex/website
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Feel free to replace the python call with your favorite 
simple https server.   I like [simple-http-server](https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server).

The geodex site is JAMstack like.  In that it is just Javascript, APIs and Markup.  

All CORS needs should be addresed but if you run into issues you can bypass CORS at the 
browser level for testing. 

The alpha site is just a place holder for now until we get the style assets. 

this repo supports https://beta.geocodes.earthcube.org/
