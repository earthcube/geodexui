#  Connecting Data to Resources

## About

The following is a diagram by Steve Richards representing some of the work the 
ECO has been doing to connect the dataset graph (nabu) to the Resource Registry 
graph.


## Notes

The registered interchange format identifiers are generally qualified standard MIME types 
with parameters to specify a particular application.

Most tools run on the user desktop on some other environment where 
the software is installed and the data must be loaded there. 

The web based application is from constructing a URL to open web application with data by
inserting the contentURL from the dataset metadata into the URLTemplate provided
by the software metadata.
